          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am currently a second-year college student, passionately pursuing
            a degree in computer science with a focus on programming and website
            design. My skill set encompasses proficiency in various programming
            languages, including C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. Over the past five
            years, I have cultivated valuable expertise in electronics repair
            and troubleshooting while working with Best Buy and Geek Squad. This
            hands-on experience has not only sharpened my problem-solving
            abilities but has also provided a solid foundation for my technical
            skills. In the realm of programming, I specialize in C#, a versatile
            language known for its application in developing Windows
            applications and web services. Additionally, my proficiency in
            Python extends to its diverse applications, from web development to
            data analysis. Moreover, I am adept at creating dynamic and
            responsive web interfaces using HTML and CSS. My journey as a
            computer science student and my professional background in
            electronics have equipped me with a unique blend of skills, making
            me well-prepared to tackle challenges in both programming and
            technology-related fields."

            <h3>Neosho Skateland</h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I conceptualized, designed, and constructed the
              primary website for Neosho Skateland Fun Center. Employing the
              Bootstrap 5 framework, I ensured a responsive and visually
              appealing design. It's worth noting that this project was
              specifically crafted for educational purposes, allowing for a
              hands-on exploration and application of web development skills.

            <h3>Giant National Bank</h3>
            <p>
              Giant National Bank serves as a fictitious entity employed in our
              coursework to simulate real-world applications. In this project, I
              leveraged C# to construct and design the client side of the bank's
              web application. The implementation involved integrating a robust
              C# backend, a SQL database for seamless data management, and
              crafting a client that interfaces with the provided API. This
              project not only honed my programming skills but also provided
              practical experience in developing sophisticated web applications
              within a simulated banking environment.
